# ECE482-Weight-Shifter

# <h2> Project Description: 
The purpose of this project is to design a weight shifter for a small aircraft. A weight of
12 kilograms must be moved over a rail of 2 meters, on a cart. The system should track and
control the precise position of the weight on the track. The weight must also be able to move
across the full length of the track in no more than 2 seconds.

# <h2> Project Requirements: 
* The weight must also be able to move across the full length of the track in no more than 2 seconds.
* All components on the cart must fit within its dimensions, without interfering with the cutout section.
* Any motors(s) selected must supply enough torque to accelerate the mass, and be rated for a high enough speed to support the worst case movement
* In the case of power failure, the weight shifter must maintain position, through the use of a failsafe brake.
